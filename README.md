# Fracture Detection using YOLOv8 

![val_batch2_labels](https://github.com/salonishenoy/FractureDetection_YOLOv8/blob/main/val_batch2_labels.jpg)

* This repository provides a complete solution for detecting 7 bone fractures in the human arm using deep learning. It includes model weights and the code for training the model.
* The annotated dataset was taken from object detection dataset from kaggle (here, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/bone-fracture-detection-computer-vision-project/data)

The model detects different specific types of bone fracture:
  1. Elbow Positive
  2. Fingers Positive
  3. Forearm Fracture
  4. Humerus Fracture
  5. Shoulder Fracture
  6. Wrist Positive
